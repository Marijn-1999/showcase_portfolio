            <h2>Solarion</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Solarion</strong> is a sci-fi, strategy-based
              city-building game where players control a colony on a distant
              planet. The game combines resource management, environmental
              challenges, and exploration as players build sustainable cities
              while navigating harsh planetary conditions and uncovering hidden
              alien technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Role:</strong> Lead Game Designer
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designed the gameâ€™s core loop, including resource management,
                construction, and expansion mechanics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led the design of dynamic environmental systems (weather,
                disasters, etc.) that affect gameplay.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created the game's narrative framework, including world-building
                and quest design.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Technologies:</strong> Unreal Engine 4, Blueprint
              Visual Scripting, Photoshop, Audacity
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> Through Solarion, I honed my ability to
              balance gameplay complexity and player agency. The project also
              helped me understand the intricacies of balancing narrative-driven
              content with freeform player-driven exploration.
