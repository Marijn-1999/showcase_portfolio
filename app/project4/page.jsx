            <h2>Lumina</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Lumina</strong> is a first-person puzzle-solving game set
              in a futuristic world. Players must navigate through intricate
              levels using light manipulation mechanics to unlock doors, create
              pathways, and solve puzzles that advance them to the next stage.
            </p>

              <strong>Role:</strong> Game Designer
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented core light-based puzzle mechanics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a level progression system that increases complexity
                as players advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked closely with the art team to ensure that the visual
                design matched the gameâ€™s narrative.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Technologies:</strong> Unity 3D (C#), Blender,
              Substance Painter, Audacity
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Outcome:</strong> Lumina allowed me to explore new
              puzzle-solving mechanics while enhancing my skills in level design
              and environment creation. The project helped refine my ability to
              create interactive, meaningful experiences.
